# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe — React

A simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe game built with React**.

I built this project while learning React from the official documentation, mainly to understand how state, components, and user interactions work in a real application.

## ✨ Why this project?

Instead of just reading React concepts, I wanted to **build something practical**.  
Tic Tac Toe is small enough to understand fully, but still powerful enough to teach important ideas like state updates, conditional rendering, and clean component design.
